# de.js
de.js contribute at DataFlow EventDriven Multi Paradime Javascript thinking about Functional Programing.

## What's a fact of javascript.
### Surely you think 
- long long property name...
- OOP ? But ! this isn't this !!!
- promise ? generator ? It's Juicy ?
- Where is myself ? Who is me ?
- Understand !
-- "this" is a bad!
-- "new" is a bad!
-- "OOP" is a bad...

## de.js is very friendly of OOP
### Sample code
~~~javascript
let MyButton = function () {
    this
    ._({
        Alice: "Who are you ?",
        CheshireCat: "I not interested about you."
    })
    ._(button.$("Push Me"))
    .on("click");
}._({
    click (e) {
        this.each((v, k) => e.$.outer.$(p.$(k + ": " + v)));
    }
});
$.body.$(article.$(new MyButton().$));
~~~

Let's hack it!
